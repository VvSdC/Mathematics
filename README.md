## üìö Topics & Their Relevance

- **Introduction to Statistics**
  - Understands data types, distributions, and summary statistics.
  - Used in every ML/DS project: data inspection, cleaning, feature analysis.

- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Summarizes data (mean, median, variance, etc.).
  - Key for feature engineering, outlier detection, and understanding model outputs.

- **Inferential Statistics**
  - Allows generalizing results from samples to populations.
  - Essential for A/B testing, drawing conclusions, and evaluating model significance.

- **Introduction to Probability**
  - Models uncertainty and event likelihood.
  - Basis for probabilistic models and risk assessment, such as Naive Bayes and anomaly detection.

- **Probability Distributions**
  - Describes how random variables behave.
  - Core for predictive modeling, defining loss functions, and understanding data/model noise.

- **Introduction to Linear Algebra**
  - Provides language for representing data and transformations.
  - Underpins almost all ML algorithms: linear regression, neural networks, PCA, embeddings.

- **Functions and Inverse Functions**
  - Maps inputs to outputs, enables normalization and transformations.
  - Used for activation functions, scaling, and invertible transformations in ML pipelines.

- **Matrices**
  - Efficient structure for storing and processing data.
  - Essential for batch data operations, matrix decompositions (e.g., SVD, PCA), image data, and more.

- **Differential Calculus**
  - Examines rates of change; foundation of optimization.
  - The engine of learning algorithms (gradient descent, backpropagation) in ML and DL.
